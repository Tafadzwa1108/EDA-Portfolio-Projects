<h1 align="left"> Business Overview/Problem</h1>
<p align="left">
NexaLink introduced VendBridge to the market just three months ago, following an extensive series of pre-launch and post-launch marketing campaigns. With a significant investment in promotional efforts, the product team wants to monitor the performance of VendBridge since its inception. The team is keen on understanding the extent to which VendBridge has been embraced by the market and also constantly monitor the app performance.

Key performance metrics (KPIs) such as daily active users (DAUs), installation rates, user sign-up figures, transaction counts, and other product analytics metrics will be used to assess VendBridge's reception and impact. By meticulously assessing these metrics, the product team can gain a precise understanding of VendBridge's reception and impact in the market as well as its performance. This will help the product team can gain valuable insights into the performance of VendBridge and identify areas where it can be improved to better meet the needs of its users.
