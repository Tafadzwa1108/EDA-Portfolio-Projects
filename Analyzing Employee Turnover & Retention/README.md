<h1 align="left"> Business Overview/Problem</h1>
<p align="left">

Over the past two years, we have noticed a steady increase in employee turnover rate at NeoTech Corporation. This trend has not only resulted in significant recruitment costs but has also led to a loss of skilled talent, and this is costing the company millions of dollars each year.

The HR department suspects a number of factors that are contributing to the high turnover rate. One of which is that the company is located in a highly competitive job market. Another factor could be because the environment is very demanding and employees are often required to work long hours and meet tight deadlines.

 The high turnover rate is having a negative impact on NeoTech Corporation's business. It is costing the company money to recruit and train new employees, and it is also disrupting the company's operations.
Rationale for the Project

    Employee turnover is the rate at which employees leave a company and are replaced by new ones. Employee turnover can have a significant impact on a company's bottom line. It costs money to recruit, train and onboard new employees. High turnover can also lead to disruptions in productivity and morale.

    Analyzing employee turnover and retention can help NeoTech Corporation to identify the root causes of its high turnover rate and to develop strategies to address these issues. By understanding why employees are leaving the company, NeoTech Corporation can Identify patterns and trends among employees who leave, and also take steps to make the company a more attractive and rewarding place to work.
