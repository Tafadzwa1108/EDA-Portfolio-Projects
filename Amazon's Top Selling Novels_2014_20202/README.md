<h1 align="left">About the DataSet</h1>
<p>The Exploratory Data analysis was conducted using Microsoft SQL Server.</p>
  
 
 <h1>Business Problem</h1>
 <p>"As a data analyst working at Amazon, I was asked to visualize data that will help the company understand the performance of the different genres of books they sell.
I know that there is an interest in details about the authors, so I showcased that as well.
The main task is to show the details about the books sold."</p>


<h1>Analysis Findings</h1>
<ol>
     <li>
       The results of the query showed that the years 2015 and 2015 had the most number of books sold; 100 books whilst 2016 had the least number of books sold; 97.
       Additional findings include that there is slight fluctuation between 100 till 97 in the total books sold as the years progressed. </li>
     
  <li>
   There has been a high fluctuation in the average price of fiction books. In regards to Non-fiction books there has been a gradual decrease in the average book price.</li>
  
  <li>
      For every author whose book ranked number one each year the average book rating has been consistently high. The average rating for non-fiction books has been steadily increasing. On the other hand, the average rating for fiction books has remained relatively stable over the past few years.
  </li>
  
  <li>
      Diving deeper into the genres of books sold, it is evident that over the course of the 7 years the average rating of Fiction books remained constant at 4.7. This could be because the quality of fiction books published during this time has remained relatively consistent.
      The average book rating for Non-Fiction books had a slight variation in the early years of 2015, 2016 and 2017. Eventually the average rating remained constant at 4.7 as well.
