<h1 align="left">About the DataSet</h1>
<p align="left"> This dataset was sourced from <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3sxwx52o3x8ozj7/olympic_games.bak?dl=0">here</a> and contains about 271,116 rows 
  and 12 columns detailing countries which won medals alongside the names, age groups of competitors and the events they particiated in. The dataset contains data from the Summer Olympics from the years 1922 till 2016. The Exploratory Data analysis was conducted using Microsoft SQL Server.</p>
  
 
 <h1>Business Problem</h1>
 <p>"As a data analyst working at a news company you are asked to visualize data that will help readers understand how countries have performed historically in the summer Olympic Games.
You also know that there is an interest in details about the competitors, so if you find anything interesting then donâ€™t hesitate to bring that in also. 
The main task is still to show historical performance for different countries, with the possibility to select your own country."</p>
